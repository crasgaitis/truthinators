# The Truthinator 3K
## About
Traditional lie detectors rely on limited metrics, reducing accuracy. We enhance detection using additional biometrics, such as EEG, and motivate honesty by introducing the risk of discomfort following deception. We achieve this by using an Arduino microcontroller to interface with a TENS device, used to send an electric current through the arm of a willing participant. The current is only initiated when a lie is detected.

This project is supported by Synaptech and made possible by the 2025 Technical Grant from the University of Washignton Engineering Student Council and Allen School Affiliate funding programs.

We presented our work (alongside an interactive demo) at the 2025 Allen School Master's & Undergraduate Research Showcase and are excited to announce that we were voted the crowd favorite "People's Choice" award.
